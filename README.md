# Chat Application
A simple browser-based chat application using .NET.
Should allow several users to talk in a chatroom and also to get stock quotes from an API using a specific command.

## Features
- Allow users to register in the application;
- Allow registered users to log in and talk with other users in a chatroom;
- Allow users to post messages as commands into the chatroom with the following format
    - Get stock code: `/{command}={parameter}` where:
        - `{command}` is a command name. Eg.: `stock`;
        - `{parameter}` is a parameter for the commmand. Eg.: `aapl.us`;

### Command: Stock
Allows users to use command `/stock` that will use `stooq.com` API to get stock data, and then post this data back to the chat room as message in the following format: 
> "`stock_code` quote is `value` per share"

The post owner will be the bot.

#### API: stooq.com
Request:
- `HTTP GET` : `https://stooq.com/q/l/?s={stock_code}&f=sd2t2ohlcv&h&e=csv`

Response:

The API result is a CSV file containing the following columns:
`Symbol`, `Date`, `Time`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close` and `Volume`.

### Event Driven: Commands and Events
Event-driven architecture is a pattern for building systems where events are used to trigger actions or updates. It is based on the idea of sending a message or an event when something happens, rather than making a request and waiting for a response. This allows for more flexibility and scalability in the system, as well as better separation of concerns.

Queuing a commands and events to be processed later allows for decoupling the sender of a command from the receiver and the processing of that command. It also allows for processing to happen asynchronously, which can improve the overall performance and scalability of the system.

Furthermore, it allows for greater fault tolerance and reliability. If one worker fails to process a command, another worker can pick it up and process it, reducing the risk of a single point of failure.


Consider this sequence diagram:
![Sequence Diagram](docs/images/sequence-diagram.png)

- User joins a Room using React's UI
- React subscribe to SignalR Hub;
- User sends a message using React UI;
- React sends message to API;
- API publishes a command `SendMessageCommand` to RabbitMQ;
- API subscribes to get `SendMessageCommand` command;
- API execute domain logic according to command;
- API stores into Database the message;
- API sends event `MessageCreatedEvent`;
- API's SignalR Hub subscribes to event `MessageCreatedEvent`, and send message to React clients;
- Bot subscribes to event `MessageCreatedEvent`;
- Bot parses message to identify if it's command
    - If message is a command, bot publishes command according to `CommandFactory` (for now it only accepts `StockCommand`);
- Bot get `StockCommand` and call `stooq.com` API;
- Bot parses the CSV into a message and publishes a command `SendMessageCommand` to RabbitMQ;


### API Documentation

## Running the Application

### Docker Compose

### Manually

Start RabbitMQ:
```
docker run -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 masstransit/rabbitmq
```

# Improvements
- Create UI to use chat;
- Create docker and docker-compose files;
- Use an identity Provider (AWS Cognito, Keycloak);
    - For now, it's a ad-hoc identity provider for the sake of simplicity
- Increase code coverage of unit tests;
- Create CI/CD pipeline
    - Github Actions is a good choice;
- Observability 
    - Generate logs using Serilog;
    - Use Sink (from Serilog) or side-car container to upload logs to APM tool;
- This is mono-repo. Ideally, should segregate and make it independent;
- Use of message broker enforced loose coupled approach, but there's still dependency on `JaniceChat.MessageBroker.Abstraction` that is shared between `JaniceChat.FinBot` and `JaniceChat.Service`.
    - Consider segregating contracts shared into a new project `JaniceChat.Contracts`;
    - For every increment, publish this new project into Nuget repository (AWS Code Artifact or Nuget.Org);
- Add authorization to SignalR/Hub route;
- Create middleware for handling exceptions;
- Add `FluentValidator` to validate models;
- SignalR is running with the API, but ideally we should use AWS Event Bridge or Azure SignalR to decouple and make it more resiliente as we scale;
